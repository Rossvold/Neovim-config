# Nvim config documentation

-Works in Linux

Telescope is going to have big issues in Windows and some in WSL.

Netrw doesn't properly work for VUE, SVELTE, NEXT type folder structures, so make sure to find a fix for that.

My tip for that is to not use Windows.

Packer for package management (i would reccomend lazy vim instead since this is
not maintained anymore as of august 2023.)

Mason for lsp's

Lua for customization
